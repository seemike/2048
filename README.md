# Make 2048
A Udacity version of Gabriele Cirulli's [﻿original 2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). 

The original version is a small clone of [﻿1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [﻿Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

### Notes for the Udacity version
We're using this version as the recommended fork to avoid potential learning issues as the original source changes (and the Udacity videos don't update). You can [﻿fork the original repo as well](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) 

## License
2048 is licensed under the [﻿MIT license.](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) 

## Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
